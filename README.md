# Logstash

Logstash is an open-source, centralized, events and logging manager. It is a part of the ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.
Logstash is a tool based on the filter/pipes patterns for gathering, processing and generating the logs or events.
It helps in centralizing and making real time analysis of logs and events from different sources.
It collects different types of data like Logs, Packets, Events, Transactions, Timestamp Data, etc., from almost every type of source. The data source can be Social data, E-commerce, News articles, CRM, Game data, Web trends, Financial data, Internet of Things, Mobile devices, etc.

## Logstash General Features
Logstash can collect data from different sources and send to multiple destinations.
Logstash can handle all types of logging data like Apache Logs, Windows Event Logs, Data over Network Protocols, Data from Standard Input and many more.
Logstash can also handle http requests and response data.
Logstash provides a variety of filters, which helps the user to find more meaning in the data by parsing and transforming it.
Logstash can also be used for handling sensor data in iot.
Logstash is open source and available under the Apache license version 2.0.

ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. In the ELK stack, Logstash extracts the logging data or other events from different input sources.
It processes the events and later stores them in Elasticsearch.
Kibana is a web interface, which accesses the logging data from Elasticsearch and visualizes it.

## LOGSTASH FILTERS
list of Logstash filters with a very brief description of each:

1. **Grok Filter**: Parse unstructured log data using predefined patterns or custom regular expressions and extract fields.

2. **Date Filter**: Parse timestamps from log data and convert them into a standardized format.

3. **JSON Filter**: Parse JSON-formatted log messages and extract specific fields from the JSON data.

4. **Mutate Filter**: Perform various operations on fields, such as renaming, removing, converting data types, or adding new fields.

5. **KV Filter**: Parse key-value pairs from log data and add them as separate fields.

6. **GeoIP Filter**: Enrich log data with geolocation information based on IP addresses.

7. **UserAgent Filter**: Extract browser and device information from user agent strings.

8. **Drop Filter**: Exclude events from further processing based on certain conditions.

9. **Conditional Filter**: Apply filters conditionally based on specific criteria.

10. **Translate Filter**: Enrich log data by adding fields based on predefined lookup tables.

11. **Fingerprint Filter**: Generate a unique hash for log events based on selected fields.

12. **Clone Filter**: Duplicate log events to send them to multiple outputs.

13. **URLDecode Filter**: Decode URL-encoded fields in log data.

14. **Prune Filter**: Remove fields from log events based on specified patterns.

15. **CSV Filter**: Parse log data in CSV format and extract fields.

16. **XML Filter**: Parse log data in XML format and extract fields.

17. **UUID Filter**: Generate UUIDs and add them as fields to log events.

18. **Aggregate Filter**: Combine multiple log events into a single event based on specified criteria.

These filters are just some of the many available in Logstash, and they can be combined and configured in various ways to handle specific data processing needs for your log data.



Parsing: Logstash filters can use patterns and regular expressions to parse log messages and extract specific fields, timestamps, and other relevant data. This is often done using the Grok filter.

Timestamp Extraction: Logstash filters can extract timestamps from log messages and convert them into a standardized format for easier analysis.

Enrichment: Logstash filters can enrich log data by adding additional fields, data, or metadata from external sources. For example, IP geolocation, user agent information, or lookup tables can be used for enrichment.

Conditional Processing: Logstash filters can apply different processing steps based on conditions. For example, different filters can be applied to log messages of different types or coming from specific sources.

JSON Parsing: Logstash filters can parse JSON-formatted log messages and extract specific fields from the JSON data.

Data Transformation: Logstash filters can transform data by renaming fields, converting data types, removing unwanted fields, or combining multiple fields into one.

Handling Multiline Logs: Logstash filters can handle multiline log entries and ensure that they are processed as single events.

Data Validation: Logstash filters can perform data validation to ensure that log messages meet certain criteria or match expected patterns.

Deduplication: Logstash filters can identify and remove duplicate log entries from the data.

Conditional Filtering: Logstash filters can apply conditional filters to exclude or include certain log messages based on specific conditions.
